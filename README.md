# üå≤ Gitcoin Grants Data Portal

Open source, serverless, and local-first Data Platform for Gitcoin Grants Data. This data hub improves data access and empower data scientists to conduct research that guides community driven analysis.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We are working to **deprecate** this version of the portal. You can now find better and more up to date datasets on [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/). The new version will be **focusing on curating Open Source Observer datasets with external datasets and publishing new augmented datasets**. New version is under [development at the `oso` branch](https://github.com/davidgasquez/grants-data-portal/tree/oso).

![DAG](https://github.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal/assets/1682202/2095974c-f8c4-430b-9c93-dd2a0598127e)

## üìÇ Gitcoin Grants Data

Datasets are living as Parquet files on IPFS! You can get them all at the [IPFS CID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal/main/data/IPFS_CID) pointer available in this repository, surfaced also in the [Data Portal Data section](https://grantsdataportal.xyz/data/).

The following command will give you a working URL to explore the available tables.

```bash
# Get the latest IPFS CID
LATEST_IPFS_CID=$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal/main/data/IPFS_CID)

# Print the Gateway URL with all the tables
echo https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/$LATEST_IPFS_CID/data/
```

### üìå IPNS

You can also go to [`ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dhn3p5xdkp8n6azd4l1mma5zujinkeewhvuh5oq4qvt7etk9tvc`](https://k51qzi5uqu5dhn3p5xdkp8n6azd4l1mma5zujinkeewhvuh5oq4qvt7etk9tvc.ipns.cf-ipfs.com/data/), which points to the latest available data via IPNS.

You can now read the files from your favorite tools. E.g: `pd.read_parquet('https://grantsdataportal.xyz/data/allo_rounds.parquet')`

## üìñ Overview

The repository contains code and artifacts to help process Gitcoin Grants data from the [Grants Stack Indexer API](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack-indexer). It is an instance of [Datadex](https://github.com/davidgasquez/datadex) allowing you and everyone else to:

- Add new data sources to the portal, collaborate on better models (ala Dune) or submit an interesting analysis.
- All in a permissionless way. Don't ask, fork it and improve the models, add a new source or update any script.
- Declarative stateless transformations tracked in git, executed in GitHub Actions and published to IPFS. Data, artifacts (like the entire DuckDB database), and models all version controlled.
- Share and explore dashboards and report with the world!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

The fastest way to start working on the Data Portal is via [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Once inside the develpment environment, you can run `make dev` to spin up the Dagster UI.

The development environment can also run in your browser thanks to GitHub Codespaces! Just click on the badge below to get started.
