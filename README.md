Open source, serverless, and local-first Data Platform for Gitcoin Grants Data. This data hub improves data access and empower data scientists to conduct research that guides community driven analysis.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This repository is under active development. The datasets might not be fully up to date and the API might undergo breaking changes. Please use it with caution.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains all the code and related artifacts to process funding data from diverse sources (on-chain and off-chain). You can go directly to the processed datasets or explore the different metrics and pipelines on this repository.

### üì¶ Key Features

- **Open**: Code and data are open source and relies on open standards and formats.
- **Permissionless Collaboration**: Collaborate on data, models, and pipelines. Fork the repo and run the platform locally in mintures. No constraints or platform lock-ins.
- **Decentralization Options**: Runs on a laptop, server, CI runner, or even on decentralized compute networks like Bacalhau. No local setup required; it even works seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces.
- **Data as Code**: Each commit generates and pushes all table files to R2.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Replace, extend, or remove individual components. Compatible with tons of tools. At the end of the day, tables are Parquet files.
- **Low Friction Data Usage**: Raw and processed data is available to anyone openly. Use whatever tool you want!
- **Modern Data Engineering**: Supports data engineering essentials such as typing, testing, materialized views, and development branches. Utilizes best practices, including declarative transformations, and utilizes state-of-the-art tools like DuckDB.

## üìÇ Gitcoin Grants Data

Datasets are living as Parquet files on IPFS! You can get them all at the [IPFS CID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal/main/data/IPFS_CID) pointer available in this repository, surfaced also in the [Data Portal Data section](https://grantsdataportal.xyz/data/).

The following command will give you a working URL to explore the available tables.

```bash
# Get the latest IPFS CID
LATEST_IPFS_CID=$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal/main/data/IPFS_CID)

# Print the Gateway URL with all the tables
echo https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/$LATEST_IPFS_CID/data/
```

### üìå IPNS

You can also go to [`ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dhn3p5xdkp8n6azd4l1mma5zujinkeewhvuh5oq4qvt7etk9tvc`](https://k51qzi5uqu5dhn3p5xdkp8n6azd4l1mma5zujinkeewhvuh5oq4qvt7etk9tvc.ipns.cf-ipfs.com/data/), which points to the latest available data via IPNS.

You can now read the files from your favorite tools. E.g: `pd.read_parquet('https://grantsdataportal.xyz/data/allo_rounds.parquet')`

## üìñ Overview

The repository contains code and artifacts to help process Gitcoin Grants data from the [Grants Stack Indexer API](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack-indexer). It is an instance of [Datadex](https://github.com/davidgasquez/datadex) allowing you and everyone else to:

- Add new data sources to the portal, collaborate on better models (ala Dune) or submit an interesting analysis.
- All in a permissionless way. Don't ask, fork it and improve the models, add a new source or update any script.
- Declarative stateless transformations tracked in git, executed in GitHub Actions and published to IPFS. Data, artifacts (like the entire DuckDB database), and models all version controlled.
- Share and explore dashboards and report with the world!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

The fastest way to start working on the Data Portal is via [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Once inside the develpment environment, you can run `make dev` to spin up the Dagster UI.

The development environment can also run in your browser thanks to GitHub Codespaces! Just click on the badge below to get started.
