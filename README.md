## üìñ Overview

The repository contains code and artifacts to help process grants around the Public Goods Ecosystem. The portal is based on the principles of [Datadex](https://github.com/davidgasquez/datadex).

### üì¶ Key Features

- **Open**: Code and data are open source and relies on open standards and formats.
- **Permissionless Collaboration**: Collaborate on data, models, and pipelines. Fork the repo and run the platform locally in mintures. No constraints or platform lock-ins.
- **Decentralization Options**: Runs on a laptop, server, CI runner, or even on decentralized compute networks like Bacalhau. No local setup required; it even works seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces.
- **Data as Code**: Each commit generates and pushes all table files to R2.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Replace, extend, or remove individual components. Compatible with tons of tools. At the end of the day, tables are Parquet files.
- **Low Friction Data Usage**: Raw and processed data is available to anyone openly. Use whatever tool you want!
- **Modern Data Engineering**: Supports data engineering essentials such as typing, testing, materialized views, and development branches. Utilizes best practices, including declarative transformations, and utilizes state-of-the-art tools like DuckDB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

The fastest way to start working on the Data Portal is via [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Once inside the develpment environment, you can run `make dev` to spin up the Dagster UI.

The development environment can also run in your browser thanks to GitHub Codespaces! Just click on the badge below to get started.
