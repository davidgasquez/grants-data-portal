Open source, serverless, and local-first Data Platform for Public Goods Grants Data. This data hub improves data access and empower data scientists to conduct research that guides community driven analysis.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The previous version of the portal (browse it [here](https://github.com/davidgasquez/grants-data-portal/tree/ea74827476e25fbc3f94aa052c15c7b681a2d183)) is **deprecated**. You can find better and more up to date data on [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/). This new approach/version **focuses on curating Open Source Observer datasets with some smaller datasets** and distributing them.

## üìñ Overview

The repository contains code and artifacts to help process grants around the Public Goods Ecosystem. The portal is based on the principles of [Datadex](https://datadex.datonic.io/).

### üì¶ Key Features

- **Open**: Code and data are open source and relies on open standards and formats.
- **Permissionless Collaboration**: Collaborate on data, models, and pipelines. Fork the repo and run the platform locally in minutes. No constraints or platform lock-ins.
- **Decentralization Options**: Runs on a laptop, server, CI runner, or even on decentralized compute networks like Bacalhau. No local setup required.
- **Data as Code**: Each commit generates and pushes all datasets as files to an Object Storage.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Replace, extend, or remove individual components. Compatible with tons of tools. At the end of the day, datasets are Parquet files.
- **Low Friction Data Usage**: Raw and processed data is available to anyone openly. Use whatever tool you want!
- **Modern Data Engineering**: Supports data engineering essentials such as typing, testing, materialized views, and development branches. Utilizes best practices, including declarative transformations, and utilizes state-of-the-art tools like DuckDB.
